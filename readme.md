## Running Restack in Docker

To run Restack locally using Docker, you have two options:

Using `docker run`:

```bash
docker run -d --pull always --name studio -p 5233:5233 -p 6233:6233 -p 7233:7233 ghcr.io/restackio/engine:main
```

This will force repulling and rebuilding.

After running either of these commands, the Restack UI will be available at http://localhost:5233
